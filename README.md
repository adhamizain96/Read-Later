# Read-Later

  The 'Read Later' extension is designed to provide users with a convenient way to save web pages for future reading. It consists of several key files that work together to deliver its functionality.
  The popup.js file plays a crucial role in defining the behavior and functionality of the extension's popup window. It contains JavaScript code that interacts with the browser's extension APIs, allowing it to handle user interactions effectively. Within this script, you will find functions responsible for saving the URL of the current page, rendering the saved URLs in the popup, and extracting the domain from a URL. The usage of the chrome.tabs API enables the script to query and access information about the active tab.
  To define the structure and appearance of the popup window, we have the popup.html file. This HTML file defines the necessary markup to create an appealing user interface within the popup. It includes elements such as a header with a title, an unordered list to display the saved URLs, and a script tag that links the JavaScript code from popup.js to the HTML file.

The manifest.json file serves as a crucial component that provides essential information about the extension. It encompasses details such as the extension's name, version, permissions, scripts, and other settings. In this specific file, you will find the required permissions for storage and active tab access. It also specifies the default popup HTML file as popup.html, and references additional files such as background.js and icon.png. It is important to note that the manifest version mentioned in this file is 2, representing the older version of Chrome extensions.

In addition to the aforementioned files, the 'Read Later' extension introduces the adjustPopupSize.js file to enhance its functionality. This JavaScript file is responsible for dynamically resizing the popup based on its content. By utilizing the chrome.windows API, the script calculates and updates the dimensions of the popup window accordingly. This ensures that the popup adjusts its size based on the number of saved URLs, providing a better user experience.

Collectively, these files (popup.js, popup.html, manifest.json, and adjustPopupSize.js) work together harmoniously to deliver the desired functionality and aesthetics of the 'Read Later' extension. The JavaScript code in popup.js handles the logic and interaction, while popup.html defines the user interface. The manifest.json file specifies the extension's settings and permissions, and the adjustPopupSize.js file contributes to dynamic resizing for an improved user experience.
