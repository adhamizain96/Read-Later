# Read-Later

The "Read Later" extension provides users with a convenient way to save web pages for future reading within the Google Chrome browser. With this extension installed, users can save the URL of the current page they are browsing with a simple click of the "Save Current Page" button in the extension's popup window.

To enhance the user experience, the size of the popup window is dynamically adjusted based on the content. The window automatically resizes to accommodate the displayed URLs, ensuring a comfortable and optimized viewing experience for the user.

Overall, the "Read Later" extension simplifies the process of saving web pages for future reading. By providing easy access to saved URLs and allowing for efficient management of saved pages, the extension streamlines the task of organizing and revisiting web content, enhancing productivity and user convenience within the Google Chrome browser.
